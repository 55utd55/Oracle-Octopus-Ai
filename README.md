# Oracle Octopus Ai
* In this project, our artificial intelligence models predict the results of football matches and the winning probabilities of the teams. \
Predictions are purely probabilistic predictions and may not reflect the actual result.
* The project can only predict league matches!
* The project was trained by giving data from the 2nd week of the league matches.
* This project was created with Python 3.9.
